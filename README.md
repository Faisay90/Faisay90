Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Front-End Developer passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. For the past year, Iâ€™ve been working at LuulSolutions, where I design and develop modern web interfaces, enhance user experiences, and contribute to delivering production-ready solutions using cutting-edge front-end technologies.

Before joining LuulSolutions, I completed a 6-month intensive bootcamp at Fast Track Software Academy, where I trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Git, and GitHub. This experience laid a strong foundation that I have since expanded upon through hands-on, real-world projects.

* HTML: Skilled in creating well-structured, semantic web content and layouts.
