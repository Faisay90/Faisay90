## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Faisa Yusuf
I'm a front-end developer currently gaining hands-on experience at LuulSolutions, where I contribute to real-world projects by building and improving web applications using modern front-end technologies.

I recently completed a 6-month intensive bootcamp with Fast Track Software Academy, where I trained in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Git, and GitHub. My work at LuulSolutions allows me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned while continuing to grow and develop my skills as a front-end developer.

## Technical Skills ðŸ’»
I have a solid foundation in the following technologies:

* HTML: Skilled in creating well-structured, semantic web content and layouts.

* CSS: Experienced in designing and styling responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

* JavaScript: Proficient in adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to web applications.

* Git: Comfortable with version control, branching, and collaborating in a team environment.
